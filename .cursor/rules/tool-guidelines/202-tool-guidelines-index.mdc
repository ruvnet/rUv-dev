# Tool Usage Guidelines Index

To prevent common errors when using tools, refer to these detailed guidelines:

## File Operations
- [File Operations Guidelines](../file-operations/101-file-operations-guidelines.mdc) - Guidelines for read_file, write_to_file, and list_files
- [Insert Content Guidelines](../file-operations/102-insert-content.mdc) - Guidelines for insert_content
- [Search and Replace Guidelines](../file-operations/103-search-replace.mdc) - Guidelines for search_and_replace

## Code Editing
- [Apply Diff Guidelines](201-apply-diff-guidelines.mdc) - Specific guidelines to prevent errors with apply_diff

## Key Points to Remember:
1. Always include all required parameters for each tool
2. Verify file existence before attempting modifications
3. For apply_diff, never include literal diff markers in code examples
4. For search_and_replace, always include both search and replace parameters
5. For write_to_file, always include the line_count parameter
6. For insert_content, always include valid line and content parameters
