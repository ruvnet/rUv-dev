Unlike classical computers that use bits (0s or 1s), quantum computers use quantum bits or 'qubits' that can exist in multiple states simultaneously through a property called superposition. This allows quantum computers to explore many possibilities at once, potentially solving certain complex problems much faster than classical computers."}]}
